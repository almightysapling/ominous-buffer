#summary Clan Lottery info.

= Introduction =

In OB's daily adventuring, he generates quite a bit of meat. A little bit of this meat is saved for his own use, as spending MP casting buffs isn't free. However most of this meat, we felt, should be given back to the users.

And, to achieve this, we created the lottery. This gives our active users a chance to earn some meat just by being in clan chat!

= Details =

At the start of his day, OB will pick 3 random times to initiate the lottery. When this time comes, OB announces the lottery and [roll rolls] a die. If the number he rolls is less than or equal to the amount of players, someone wins!

If nobody wins, the size of the pot increases by 14,000 meat, and the "backup" lottery increases by 2,000. If someone wins, the pot is awarded and the backup lottery is brought forward to seed the next lottery.

The size of the die rolled changes each lottery to keep the chances of a win at a relatively low percent, to give the lottery time to grow.

The exact percentage is given by the following function:
{{{
if x > 7
  y = max(1.4 + floor(x/2)*0.24, 4)
if x <= 7
  y = 0.4 + x*2/(1+x)
}}}
Where x is the amount of active users and y is the percentage of a winner.
