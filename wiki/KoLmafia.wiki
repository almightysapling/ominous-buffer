#summary Description about Mafia

= Introduction =
KoLmafia is a Java powered front-end for Kingdom of Loathing. It allows users who are more familiar with the game to automate large sections of play to ameliorate the more tedious tasks. It also homes a rather fancy script interpreter named ASH.
It is with KoLmafia and ASH that Ominous Buffer is possible.
